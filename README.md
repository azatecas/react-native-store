# DoneWithIt

react-native client application that allows users to upload items to sell and allow communication between the seller and the buyer. Currently this application is just the front end. The backend will be made once the Client App functions properly with dummy data. 

This is a tutorial project from codingwithmosh.com. The starter code is used to understand the aspects of React Native to make client applications for Android and iOS. However, the tutorial does not provide a backend or database to keep the data persistant (That is the next step of the project).
This Application utilizes the EXPO and React-Native Framework. This application is still a work in progress and has not been published to Expo, Google Play, or iOS App store.
